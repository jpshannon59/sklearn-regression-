Matplotlib and Seaborn used with sklearn linear regression
1. Create a statistical summary of the data in the file “CommuteStLouis.csv”. Plot a histogram of age for the CommuteStLouis data.


2. For the data CommuteStLouis:
a. Produce a correlation matrix of age, distance and time. Which two numeric variables are most highly correlated? What is the correlation coefficient for the above pair? 



b. Create a scatterplot matrix of the numeric variables in the data. What do the figures in the diagonal going from the top left to the bottom right show? What can you say about the skewness of the various attributes?



c. Produce a side-by-side boxplot of distance travelled by gender. Do the data in the file indicate that women tend to commute shorter distances?




3. For the pair in Question 2.a plot the scatter plot. Also superimpose a linear regression line on the plot.



4. Show the distribution of residuals of the data from Part 3.
